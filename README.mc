# push_swap Project Overview

## Introduction

The **push_swap** project is a command‑line program that computes an
efficient sequence of operations to sort a list of integers. The sorting
process is performed using two stacks and a strictly limited set of
allowed operations, making the task an algorithmic and structural
challenge centered around constrained problem‑solving.

## Purpose

The project explores how complex sorting behavior can be achieved within
a minimal operational model. By requiring the program to output an
optimized sequence of stack operations rather than performing the sort
directly, the project emphasizes control‑flow design, data‑structure
organization, and thoughtful algorithm selection.

## Core Functionality

The program: - Accepts a series of integer arguments. - Validates and
parses input, ensuring correctness and safety. - Constructs two stacks
used throughout the sorting procedure. - Determines an operation
sequence that sorts the values placed in Stack A. - Outputs the
operations in the exact order needed to complete the transformation.

The allowed operations include: - **Swap:** interchange the top elements
of a stack. - **Push:** move the top element from one stack to
another. - **Rotate:** shift all elements of a stack upward. - **Reverse
Rotate:** shift all elements downward.

These constraints require a carefully structured approach to produce a
minimal or near‑minimal instruction set.

## Architectural Overview

The repository is organized into: - `src/` --- operational logic,
parsing routines, and sorting strategy - `include/` --- type definitions
and function declarations - `libft/` --- reusable utilities and helper
functions - `Makefile` --- build automation and project rules

This separation promotes clarity, maintainability, and ease of
navigation.

## Sorting Approach

The sorting method adapts based on dataset size: - Smaller datasets rely
on direct, deterministic instruction patterns. - Larger input sizes
benefit from strategies such as chunk segmentation, cost‑based movement,
and optimized rotations.

The combination ensures predictable behavior and consistent performance
across varying input complexities.

## Output Format

The program prints stack operations line‑by‑line. When executed
sequentially, these operations transform the initial unsorted stack into
a fully ordered one.

Example:

    pb
    ra
    pa

## Project Characteristics

The project emphasizes: - Deterministic control over data
transformations\
- Efficient logical structuring of stack operations\
- Clear separation of concerns within the codebase\
- Consistent behavior across all edge cases, including duplicates,
invalid input, and extreme values

## Conclusion

The **push_swap** project showcases a constraint‑based approach to
sorting, highlighting how limited operations can be orchestrated to
perform non‑trivial transformations on structured data. The project
provides a cohesive implementation with attention to correctness,
stability, and overall architectural organization.
